#### I have addressed the following components:
##### 1) I have included a landing page named index.html and it let people know what the site is about and contains the necessary links and navigation for people to get around the site. Below you can find a screenshot
##### 2) I have included a menu bar on top of the page on my every html page so that it is easy to navigate and there are no dead ends and the user can use the home button which is named "Posrtfolio" to get back to home page from anywhere which makes sure the user doesnot have to use the browser navigational button. I also have taken care of if the website is viewed on a small screen then the menu bar is still usable.
##### 3) I have implemented two or more internal links which links to my other pages i.e.  About, Skills, Porjects, Contact sections page which can be navigated through the menu bar

##### 4) I have also included more than one external link which opens in a new browser tab. This links are implemented in my contact section on the icons. There are icons of linkedn, facebook, instagram, clicking on it will open the respective page in a new tab. Screen shot of the same can be found below for reference purposes
